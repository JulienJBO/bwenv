# bwenv

`bwenv` resolves 1Password-style `op://` references from Bitwarden or
Vaultwarden through the official `bw` CLI. Version `2.2.0` is intended for
local use and a GitHub Actions self-hosted macOS runner running as the same
user that owns the Keychain entry; hosted GitHub runners and other users are
not supported.

## Install and configure

`bwenv.py` only requires Python 3. On a self-hosted instance, configure the
Bitwarden CLI once and authenticate interactively:

```sh
bw config server https://bitwarden-poc.kefapps.wtf
bw login
bw unlock
```

Install the explicit `bwenv` command:

```sh
./scripts/install-bwenv.sh
```

The installer creates an atomic standalone copy at `~/.local/bin/bwenv` (or
`BWENV_BIN_DIR`) and never replaces, aliases, or intercepts the official `op`
command. Reinstallation replaces only a previously marked `bwenv` copy.

The CLI must be unlocked whenever `bwenv` resolves a reference. For a
LaunchAgent, save the resulting session in the logged-in user's macOS
Keychain:

```sh
python3 bwenv.py keychain set-session --service bwenv.bitwarden-poc.kefapps.wtf
python3 bwenv.py --keychain-service bwenv.bitwarden-poc.kefapps.wtf read \
  op://Infra/service/token
```

The stored session can expire or be revoked. Refresh it interactively with
`keychain set-session`; `bwenv` deliberately fails rather than prompting from
a background process.

## Fast, bounded vault synchronization

The first `bwenv read`, `run`, or `inject` synchronizes through the official
Bitwarden CLI. Successful syncs are then reused for **5 minutes** by other
`bwenv` processes using the same server and account. The check is guarded by an
OS file lock to prevent simultaneous agents from each starting a network sync.

Only a one-byte success marker and its timestamp are persisted in
`~/.cache/bwenv/` (or `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/bwenv/`): **no decrypted items,
credentials, sessions, or secret values are cached by bwenv**. Each read still
consults the official CLI's local encrypted vault. The cache directory and
marker require owner-only permissions.

```sh
# Fast local reads after an initial successful sync:
bwenv read bw://Infra/service/token

# Mandatory immediately after rotating a credential in Vaultwarden:
bwenv --force-sync read bw://Infra/service/token

# Strictly offline/local read, even when no recent sync exists:
bwenv --no-sync read bw://Infra/service/token

# Restore the prior policy (sync every time):
BWENV_SYNC_TTL_SECONDS=0 bwenv read bw://Infra/service/token
```

Set `BWENV_SYNC_TTL_SECONDS` to a non-negative integer to change the
default 300-second freshness window. A failed sync is **never** recorded as
successful; it fails closed. If account identity is unavailable from `bw
status`, every ordinary call synchronizes rather than trusting a shared
marker. After a key rotation, use `--force-sync` explicitly: a recently
synchronized local vault may still contain the preceding key.

Performance depends on the local `bw` CLI and vault size; the TTL removes
the repeated network roundtrip but does not cache or skip local item lookup.

## Reference resolution

The native form is:

```text
bw://<organisation>/<item>/<champ>
```

The 1Password compatibility form stays supported and resolves identically:

```text
op://<organisation>/<item>/<champ>
```

Both forms share one parser and one resolution path. `bwenv` finds the exact
Vaultwarden organisation, then the exact item name, then an exact custom field.
Custom fields take precedence over `username`, `password`, `notes`, and
`note`.

For migrations, an item may instead contain the original `op://organisation/item`
or full `op://organisation/item/champ` in a Bitwarden login URI. This URI
lookup is only used after direct lookup fails, for `op://` and `bw://`
references alike. Missing and ambiguous matches always fail; no value is
guessed.

## Commands

```sh
# Print one value to stdout.
python3 bwenv.py read bw://Infra/service/token

# Resolve environment variables whose entire value is bw://... or op://... .
TOKEN=bw://Infra/service/token python3 bwenv.py run -- ./service

# Read an env file before starting the child.
bwenv run --env-file .env -- ./service

# Inject braced or bare bw:// (or op://) references from stdin to stdout.
printf 'token={{ bw://Infra/service/token }}\n' | python3 bwenv.py inject

# Render a file atomically. Existing output requires --force when noninteractive.
python3 bwenv.py inject -i runtime.env.tpl -o runtime.env --file-mode 0600 --force
```

`inject` accepts `-i/--in-file`, `-o/--out-file`, `--file-mode`, and
`-f/--force`, matching the relevant `op inject` workflow. Output files are
created through a same-directory temporary file and atomically renamed; the
default mode is `0600`.

`run`, `read`, and `inject` accept `--keychain-service` before the command:

```sh
python3 bwenv.py --keychain-service bwenv.bitwarden-poc.kefapps.wtf run -- ./service
```

`BW_SESSION` is used only while `bwenv` queries `bw`; it is removed before the
child process starts. Diagnostics never include resolved values or `bw` stderr.

## Import a 1Password fallback export

The import command accepts the protected fallback JSON produced for the
1Password quota incident. It requires a regular file with mode `0600` (or
stricter), reads only `secrets`, and imports only valid `op://` entries. Entries
such as `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` are excluded automatically.

Run the local, value-free dry-run first:

```sh
python3 bwenv.py import-1password-fallback \
  --file /Users/jbodin/messenger-connector-secrets-fallback.json
```

The dry-run does not invoke `bw` and prints only counts by organisation plus a
plan digest. To apply, first create the target organizations and one existing
collection in each of them. `bwenv` does not create organizations or
collections. It refuses to overwrite an item with the same organization and
name, and performs all organization, collection, and collision checks before
creating the first item.

```sh
python3 bwenv.py --keychain-service bwenv.bitwarden-poc.kefapps.wtf \
  import-1password-fallback \
  --file /Users/jbodin/messenger-connector-secrets-fallback.json \
  --apply \
  --plan-digest <digest-from-dry-run> \
  --receipt /path/to/import-receipt.json \
  --collection Infra=Deployments \
  --collection 'Personal Ops=Deployments'
```

Each imported item stores every path field as a custom Bitwarden field, which
preserves the `op://organisation/item/champ` contract exactly, and stores the
source URI in login URI metadata for renamed-item migrations. `--apply` is the
only command that sends a fallback value to Vaultwarden. The receipt is
structural, written atomically with mode `0600`, and lets a failed import
resume safely with the same digest. Each pending entry also carries a
deterministic non-secret marker, so recovery never adopts an unrelated item
with the same name. Login URI match metadata uses Bitwarden's numeric `Exact`
value (`3`), as required by `bw create item`.

```sh
bwenv --keychain-service bwenv.bitwarden-poc.kefapps.wtf rollback \
  --receipt /path/to/import-receipt.json
```

Rollback deletes only IDs in that receipt, verifies their absence, and is
idempotent. Neither dry-run output, diagnostics, receipts, nor logs contain
secret values or raw `bw` stderr.

## LaunchAgents

Copy and adapt
[`launchd/com.bwenv.runtime.example.plist`](launchd/com.bwenv.runtime.example.plist).
It is a generic wrapper only: no existing service is changed by this project.

## Development

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -v
python3 -m py_compile bwenv.py
```

## CI boundary

The supported CI path is only a GitHub Actions self-hosted macOS runner under
the same account as the configured Keychain service. The workflow installs and
invokes `bwenv` explicitly; it does not pass `BW_SESSION`, a Bitwarden
password, or an unlock token through GitHub Secrets. Hosted GitHub runners and
generic CI environments are deliberately outside this support contract.
